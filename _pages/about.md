Hello! I am Hengyu Meng, a first-year MPhil student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), supervisied by Prof. Zeyu Wang in [CIS Lab](https://cislab.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). 

Before joining HKUST (GZ), I earned my bachelor's degree from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2024, focusing on game development, particularly for [SimulatorX](https://simulatorx.org/), a simulation platform for the RoboMaster robotics competition :robot:. 

Now, my research focuses on differential geometry for human-centric artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) and occasionally explores artistic applications :dizzy:.
