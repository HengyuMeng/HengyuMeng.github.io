Hello! I am Hengyu Meng, a MPhil student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), supervisied by Prof. Zeyu Wang in [CIS Lab](https://cislab.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) and co-supervised by Prof. [Ligang Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/). 

Before joining HKUST (GZ), I earned my bachelor's degree from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2024, focusing on game development, particularly for [SimulatorX](https://simulatorx.org/), a simulation platform for the RoboMaster robotics competition :robot:. 

My current research centers on differential geometry processing for human-centric 3D generation and human-computer interaction (HCI). I also maintain an active interest in exploring artistic applications of computational technologies. :dizzy:.
